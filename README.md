# Grade 12 Computer Science ISP

Overall expectations being assessed in this independent study project:

* A1. 	demonstrate the ability to use different data types and expressions when creating computer programs;
* A2. 	describe and use modular programming concepts and principles in the creation of computer programs;
* A4. 	use proper code maintenance techniques when creating computer programs.
* B1. 	demonstrate the ability to manage the software development process effectively, through all of its stages â€“ planning, development ... and closing;
* B2. 	apply standard project management techniques in the context of a student-managed ... project.
* C1. 	demonstrate the ability to apply modular design concepts in computer programs;

In all phases of this ISP, you will be guided by an exemplar produced by Mr. Gordon.

The emphasis in this ISP is on understanding and applying the process of software development. The greatest success has historically come to students who plan their deliverables according to a manageeable schedule and stick to their plan.

## Scope

Aim to create a modest application that solves a problem you care about. If you solve the problem well, it is highly likely that others will find your application useful as well. Challenge yourself with something new, but avoid overreaching.

## Due dates

Planning, development, and closing will occur by the start of March Break. You can set due dates for deliverables in your project. You are strongly recommended to plan deliverable dates by working around due dates for deliverables in your other classes.

Note that you will be granted significant opportunities to work in class, but that there is, like any Grade 12 university preparation course, an expectation that work be completed outside of class time as well.

## Proposal

Modify this document and add your responses to the following prompts below.

### What problem will your application solve?

My game is intended to be something that can be played quickly and is engaging for short periods of time, making it perfect for subway rides, breaks, or any other short periods of time where one may be bored.


### What is your inspiration for this project?

*Have you seen another application that you wish to improve on? Has someone asked you to create this?*
Back when I was about 10(?) years old me and my sister found the game Tap Tap Revenge, which was our favourite thing to play against each other. About a year or two ago I believe that the app was taken down from the store for lack of updates, and I wish to re-create it for nostalgic reasons.

### What is your prior experience in this area?

I have worked briefly with SpriteKit and have made apps for iOS.

### What are skills do you hope to acquire by completing this project?

*For example, you might be writing a networked application for the first time. Or, you may be writing an application that requires a particularly well designed user interface. Describe what you expect to learn by writing this application.*
I wish to learn the basics of SpriteKit and touch gesture recognition, as these appear to be key features to and graphics have iOS application.

### What dependencies, if any, will be required to complete your project?

SpriteKit and some audio player.

### Rate the personal difficulty level of this project.

I believe that this will be tough enough to provide a challenge but easy enough to be definitely doable.

### Identify what you think your biggest challenge for successfully completing this ISP will be.

If I get far in, to have the audio be read and a sequence automatically generated.

### Make storyboards to indicate the user interface and/or functionality of your application.
